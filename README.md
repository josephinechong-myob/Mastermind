# Mastermind

This mastermind game has been developed in C# for this [kata](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/main/katas/kata-mastermind/kata-master-mind.md). 

## Game objective

In a nutshell, the player (aka. 'code-breaker') has 60 tries to solve the colour pattern that the 'code-maker' (aka. computer) has set. Hints return are random, with Black hints indicating a colour is correct and correctly positioned, and a white hint indicating a colour was correctly guessed but incorrect position. 

## Run & Build Notes
You need to be able to read the code on an IDE that can compile C# (i.e. Rider). The game is played on the terminal.

## Coding principles used:
- TDD (Test driven development)
- Good testing code coverage
- Test doubles & Mocks & Stubs
- Interfaces
- Inline testing & Facts (Unit tests)
- Constructor methods & public fields 
- Single responsibility principle (SRP) to write functions
- DRY principle (do not repeat yourself)
- Readability for functions and their names
